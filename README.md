# R_FriedmanTest_DurbinConoverPostHocTest_project
A very simple project that I worked on to run a nonparametric Friedman test with Durbin Conover post hoc tests using the `ggstatsplot` package

This code is especially useful if one is in a hurry since it required minimal lines of code with fast computing speeds.
